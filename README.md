# Processing-Bouncing-Balls

A simple Processing Project with a main file `Bouncing Ball`  and a file containing the class `Ball`.

When run, the program creates 200 Balls (2D circles) of the same size, with random positions on the screen, velocities and colors. The Balls are contained within the window size, which is set to 1000x1000 pixels.
